## About me
- 🎓 I’m currently studying Computer Science and building projects that bridge systems programming and user-facing web apps.  
- 🔭 Right now I’m working on full-stack web projects and systems programming assignments.  
- 🌱 I’m learning modern web frameworks, C++ performance patterns, and cloud deployment.  
- 💬 Ask me about C++, algorithms, or how to structure a full-stack project from idea → deployment.

## Tech stack
**Languages:** C++, Python, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS  
**Frameworks / Tools:** Node.js, Express, React/Next.js, Git, Docker  
**Other:** SQL, REST APIs, Linux, AWS (basic)
